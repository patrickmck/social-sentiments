# Social Media Sentiment as Price Predictor
This project acts as a test-bed for exploring two different ideas from machine learning: natural language processing (NLP) vs. large language models (LLMs) for textual sentiment analysis; and the value of quantitative vs qualitative predictors for numerical predictions about financial assets.

### Overview
The questions we're trying to answer are:
1. Given a bunch of text data, can we map individual comments to (a) some specific stock or crypto ticker code; (b) a sentiment that the author is expressing _about_ that particular asset.
2. If the first goal is achievable -- can that sentiment data, along with other numerical data about social media chatter, provide any predictive signal for a volatile asset like a memecoin.
